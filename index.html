	<h1>Airports are fun!</h1>
	<h3>Kenneth Burchfiel</h3>
		<p>
		I've enjoyed going to airports since I was a little kid. Although I know that many adults dread traveling, I still think airports are a great place to visit! </p>

		<p>At airports, particularly international travel hubs, you can meet individuals from all over the world. You also have the chance to try out different food and buy huge amounts of chocolate at duty-free shops. One of my favorite things to do at airports, though, is to look at the giant aircraft parked outside the gates. Those planes are some of the most sophisticated and impressive pieces of technology on the planet. </p>
		
		<p>If you happen to like airports as well, you might enjoy watching the airport tours that I have uploaded to my YouTube channel. These tours offer an overview of various U.S. and international airports. You can access them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYtyZPMUWeI9041CFmsThscnubE7A1rNE" target="_blank">at this playlist.</a> In addition, <b>you can view my latest airport tour (of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport) below!</b></p>

		<p><i>Note: the background image is a still of a video I took of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I plan to create a video tour of this airport after I'm finished with schoolwork for the semester.  </i></p>

			<h1>My favorite airports include:</h1>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Washington Dulles Airport.</b> I grew up in Northern Virginia, so many of my travel adventures started here.</li>
				<li><b>Denver International Airport.</b> Colorado is one of my favorite states, and I like the architecture and mountain views that this airport provides.</li>
				<li><b>Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.</b> DFW's design makes it easy to get from one terminal to another. There are also terrific food options in Terminal D.</li>
				<li><b>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.</b> ATL was the busiest airport in the world in 2019 (by passenger count), so it's an exciting place to visit (unless you hate crowds).  </li>
				<li><b>Tokyo Narita International Airport.</b> Japan is an amazing country to visit, and Narita is a fun airport to walk around, especially because you can see so many widebody aircraft outside.</li>
				<li><b>London Heathrow International Airport.</b> I enjoyed seeing lots of 747s and A380s at LHR when I last visited, and I was also impressed by the architecture of Terminal 5, British Airways' main base.</li>
