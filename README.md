This website was created as part of a project for my Digital Literacy at Decision Makers project at Columbia Business School. 

The code is based on code provided by Professor Chris Castiglione. That code is available [here](https://github.com/castig/castig.github.io), and his website is available [here](https://castig.github.io/).
